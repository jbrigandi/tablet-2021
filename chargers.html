        <h2>Los Angeles Chargers History</h2>
        <p>The Chargers were established with seven other American Football League teams in 1959. 
          They began AFL play in Los Angeles the following year in 1960. The Chargers' original owner
           was hotel heir Barron Hilton, son of Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton. In the 1994 season, 
           the Chargers made their first and, so far, only Super Bowl appearance, against the 49ers in Super 
           Bowl XXIX. They got to the Super Bowl by winning their first six regular season games, the only NFL 
           team to do so in 1994, and finished the season 11â€“5. However, the Chargers ended up losing in the Super Bowl, 
           and have not won an AFC championship game since then. </p>
